        <p> The British television drama Top Boy, which first hit screens back in 2011, has established a huge following for its gripping and authentic depiction of the lives of the people connected to the Summerhouse Estate, but after two short seasons, Channel 4—the channel it debuted on—decided not to re-commission the show, and just like that, one of the UK’s most-loved crime dramas appeared to be over in 2013.</p>

        <p>But all was not lost. A Canadian rapper by the name of Drake, whose long-time love for London and the UK has been well-documented, watched season one and two of Top Boy on Netflix after being recommended it whilst on tour, sparking a chain of events that resulted in its return half a decade later as a Netflix Originals series, and the artist becoming one of the executive producers. Netflix reportedly spent $2 billion on marketing in 2018, with 85% of that budget spent on ‘title brands’, i.e. Netflix Originals. Top Boy billboards were recently seen in New York’s Times Square ahead of its worldwide release on September 13—a sign of things to come.</p>

        <p>Actor Ashley Walters, who plays ‘Dushane’ on the show, helped to connect the dots that led to the revival of Top Boy—arguably his biggest role in a distinguished career. In 2004, director Saul Dibb offered Walters a role in the movie Bullet Boy, which changed his life and opened doors for him as an actor, and since then, his performances on screen have continued to improve, and his legacy continues to grow. Ashley’s highlights include starring in 50 Cent’s biopic Get Rich or Die Tryin’, Doctor Who, Grange Hill and countless other UK TV shows. More recently, we’ve seen the former So Solid Crew MC take on a lead role as ‘Officer Ronnie Pike Jr’ in Sky One’s Bulletproof, alongside Noel Clarke. </p>

        <p>Complex caught up with Ashley Walters to discuss Top Boy’s return, working with Aubrey Graham and what he really thinks of the new music from co-star Kane Robinson.</p>

        <p> </p>

        <p><b>I think I speak for most people when I say that I’m gassed Top Boy is finally back. But why was there a six-year gap between the last season of the show and this new one?</b><p>

        <p>We lost our commission from Channel 4. For what reasons, I don’t know, so the show didn’t have a home anymore. They just chose not to go onto season three, which was hard to deal with for all of us because, you know, we love the show so much. We were getting constant love from people who’d seen it, asking when it was coming back. It was only when Netflix put it on their platform, season one and two, that the rest of the world started to see it, and it just opened it up. That resulted in Drake stumbling across it and becoming a big fan of the show and then posting about it, which created another surge of interest. Then he got in contact with me and I spoke with his camp, we had a discussion about bringing it back, and I passed on some info regarding the right people to talk to. Cut a long story short, a year later, it was happening. </p> 

        <p><b>In that gap between Drake showing interest and the show actually happening, how did you feel? Did you lose hope at all? </b></p>

        <p>I did. There were moments where I thought, ‘What is happening? Why has nobody got back to me?’ But I suppose I just had to trust the process. Drake and his camp are people of their word. I’ve never seen them say they’re going to do something and not do it. It was just about being patient and waiting to see what happens. As I’ve grown in the game, you understand that it’s not as easy as you think to make things happen; there’s a lot of things you have to do to get to that stage. </p>

        <p><b>Gentrification is a big theme throughout Top Boy. Tell us about that aspect of it.</b></p>

        <p>It’s a big theme because it has a big effect on an area. In my opinion, gentrification can sometimes affect what’s happening on the ends. You’re placing people in different places, moving them around, and you’re taking them out of their comfort zone and into places they’re not used to being in. Sometimes that can create territorial wars—it can put people that come from different ends in with other people. So, for us, it was really important to talk about that in the show because that’s what’s happening right now. It wouldn’t be Top Boy of us to make a show that didn’t involve the issues that we’re all dealing with on a day-to-day basis.</p>

        <p><b>As well as gangster moments, Top Boy deals with the emotional side of what goes on very well, such as mental health, drug addiction, parenthood and poverty. How does Top Boy manage to achieve such a high level of authenticity? </b></p>

        <p>[Top Boy creator] Ronan [Bennett] does that very well, because he lives in the area. He lives right bang, smack-in-the-middle of the area that Top Boy is set. He knows the community there—he’s got strong ties throughout the community. All of his stories are based on some sort of truth. That’s how it pretty much starts: him putting those ideas on paper, then us actors bringing those ideas to life when it comes to how it sounds and putting the finishing touches on it. Ronan is a very down to earth, true to his heart sort of person, and all of the themes that he puts through the series are things that are actually happening in the area we’re trying to represent. There’s a lot of consultancy that happens. We speak to a lot of people from the area, and they come on board and help us with ideas when writing. I think it takes that to make a show like this as authentic as it is. </p>

        <p><b>Your character, ‘Dushane’, seems like a different person this time around. There’s a sense of desperation and it seems like he’s hit rock-bottom and has to build his way back up to the top. How did you adjust your mindset as Dushane to go from top boy to what we see in the new season?</b></p>

        <p>For me, as an actor, to do that whole going from top to rock-bottom and trying to build up again, that’s the most fun. For me, as Ashley, it’s not hardship. For Dushane, the character, it must be the hardest thing in the world. Once you’ve been at the top, you’re always gonna know what it’s like to be at the top. If you’ve never been at the top, you’re not worrying about what it feels like being there. It’s always a thing of having to maintain. The one good thing about Dushane is that he’s always methodical with how he makes his decisions and how he moves forward. So it’s just about how he’s going to navigate it, and for the audience, that’s the beauty of this journey. Would you really want him to start at the top? Where would we go?</p>

        <p><b>The new season is longer than the other seasons, which were both four episodes each. How will the show differ now that it’s spread across 10 episodes?</b></p>

        <p>What I think you’re going to get is a much more well-rounded understanding of each character. We’ve had ten episodes to fill, so we’ve had a chance to build. When you watch season one and two, it’s straight in from the get-go and pretty much full-on until the end. What we didn’t get to see was how people are affected by a lot of the things that were happening, after they happened. What was the fallout with the police? What were the repercussions? And how did this guy’s mum feel, the guy that had been killed? We didn’t really get to feel those emotions before. We’ve got a bigger cast and introduced some new people to the show, which has given us that space to honour the characters properly.</p>
